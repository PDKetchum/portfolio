# portfolio

## Overview

To show employers that I am a good canidate for hiring, I built a portfolio to show case my talent.

I made sure to include in my page:

- My name and a photo
- Programs I had experience in
- Previous applications built by me
- Contact information

I learned how wireframing helps in designing a web page from scratch.
